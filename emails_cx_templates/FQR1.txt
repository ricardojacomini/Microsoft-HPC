Dear Stephen,

 

My name is Guidion(Gideon) Sama and I'm the Sr. support engineer who will be helping you with High Performance Computing.
I'm available from Monday to Friday from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM EST.

 

If you need assistance outside of my business hours, please feel free to reach out to my colleagues at azurebu@microsoft.com.


Please make sure when replying to this email that supportmail@microsoft.com is included in the list of email recipients in order to keep the case communication up to date.

Would you be available for a quick call to help clarify your case? I’m currently free and can either send you a Teams meeting link or give you a call—whichever you prefer. Let me know what works best for you!

 

Stated Issues:

Failure in cluster provisioning when requesting 40 HBV4 VMs on Azure, resulting in only 38 VMs being provisioned.
A bug in the Parallel Works middleware prevented the shutdown of the partially provisioned cluster, causing it to run from May 22nd to July 2nd, 2025, incurring significant costs.  
Additionally, a bug in the Parallel Works middleware failed to shut down the partially provisioned cluster because the VMs lacked DNS records needed by the SLURM scheduler to resolve and terminate them.  
Questions for Clarity:

Are you using Cyclecloud or other Slurm cluster management mechanism?
What is the region this happen?
what methodology are you using for notification
 

Action Plan: After we gather the responses, we will investigate internally:
- We will investigate why Azure did not notify you about the unused large compute resources running since May 22nd, 2025.
- Check availability in the regions during May 22nd

 

Next Contact:
- We will provide an update on our findings and any necessary actions by Monday, July 14th, 2025.

 

Please let us know if there are any additional details or questions you have at this time. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to resolve this issue.

Best regards,
