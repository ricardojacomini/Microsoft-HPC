# HPC Pack Cluster Deployment Script

## üìå Overview

This PowerShell script automates the deployment of an HPC Pack cluster in Azure. It provisions a single-head-node cluster optimized for Windows workloads and sets up a new Active Directory domain.

### The deployment includes:

- Azure Resource Group creation  
- Head node and compute node provisioning  
- Active Directory domain setup  
- Optional Key Vault access configuration

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure the following:

- Azure PowerShell module (`Az`) is installed  
- Contributor access to the target Azure subscription  
- Access to a custom image (if using `headNodeImageResourceId` or `computeNodeImageResourceId`)  
- Permissions to assign roles in Azure Key Vault (if using Key Vault integration)  

---


## ‚öôÔ∏è Script Features

- Interactive Azure subscription selection  
- Secure admin password prompt  
- Optional authentication key override  
- Resource group validation and recreation  
- Parameterized deployment using ARM templates  
- Role assignment for Key Vault access  
- **Automated Virtual Network, subnet, and Network Security Group (NSG) creation for cluster nodes**  
- **InfiniBand (RDMA) support for HB120rs v3 nodes, including Mellanox WinOF2 driver installation and validation**  
---


## üîë Key Functions

### `Grant-KeyVaultAdminAccess`
Assigns the signed-in user the **Key Vault Administrator** role for the Key Vault in the specified resource group.

### `deploy_hpc_pack_cluster_ib.ps1`
Automates deployment of an HPC Pack cluster with InfiniBand (IB) support for HB120rs v3 nodes. This script:

- Creates a resource group, Virtual Network, subnet, and NSG with rules for RDP, SMB, and RDMA
- Deploys HB120rs v3 VMs into the subnet with accelerated networking
- Installs Mellanox WinOF2 drivers on each node and validates RDMA capability
- Outputs status for each step and ensures the cluster is RDMA/IB-ready

> **Note:** Update the script's network address ranges and admin credentials as needed for your environment.

## üöÄ Usage

### For Standard Cluster Deployment
1. Open PowerShell and run the script:
   ```powershell
   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File .\deploy_hpc_pack_cluster.ps1
   ```
2. Select your Azure subscription from the GUI prompt.  
3. Enter the admin password when prompted.  
4. Optionally enter a custom authentication key.  
5. Monitor deployment progress in the Azure Portal.  


### For InfiniBand/RDMA Cluster Deployment (HB120rs v3)
1. Edit `deploy_hpc_pack_cluster_ib.ps1` to set your desired resource group, VNet, subnet, and admin credentials.
2. To perform a dry-run (no resources will be created, just validation):
   ```powershell
   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File .\deploy_hpc_pack_cluster_ib.ps1 -DryRun
   ```
3. To run the actual deployment:
   ```powershell
   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File .\deploy_hpc_pack_cluster_ib.ps1
   ```
4. The script will create the required network infrastructure, deploy HB120rs v3 VMs, and configure InfiniBand support automatically.  
5. Monitor deployment and driver installation status in the console and Azure Portal.

## üìù Notes

- The `deploy_hpc_pack_cluster_ib.ps1` script is designed for clusters requiring low-latency, high-throughput networking (RDMA/InfiniBand), such as MPI workloads.
- The script automates all network and firewall setup for the cluster nodes.
- Mellanox WinOF2 driver installation and RDMA validation are performed on each node.
- Monitor deployment status in the Azure Portal under **Resource Group > Deployments** and check VM console output for driver/IB status.

## üîç InfiniBand Evaluation and Diagnostics

For comprehensive InfiniBand deployment evaluation, refer to **`InfiniBand-Evaluation-Notes.md`** which includes:

- Essential PowerShell commands for RDMA adapter verification
- Mellanox ConnectX-6 feature analysis and status interpretation
- Performance tuning considerations (DevX, SR-IOV, QoS)
- Advanced diagnostic tools and troubleshooting procedures
- Registry configuration guidance for optimization

Use these diagnostic commands to validate your InfiniBand configuration after deployment:
```powershell
Get-NetAdapterRdma
Get-SmbClientNetworkInterface
Mlx5Cmd.exe -Features -Name "Ethernet 2"
```

## ‚ö° ARM Template Customizations

### **Standard SKU Public IP Support**

The `new-1hn-wincn-ad.json` ARM template has been **customized** to use **Standard SKU** public IP addresses instead of Basic SKU:

#### **What was changed:**
```json
// ADDED Standard SKU configuration:
"sku": {
  "name": "Standard",
  "tier": "Regional"
},
// CHANGED allocation method:
"publicIPAllocationMethod": "Static"  // was "Dynamic"
```

#### **Benefits of Standard SKU:**
- ‚úÖ **Higher quota availability** - 1000+ per region vs 0 for Basic in many regions
- ‚úÖ **Static IP addresses** - IP doesn't change when VM restarts
- ‚úÖ **99.99% SLA** availability guarantee  
- ‚úÖ **Secure by default** - Requires explicit NSG rules for inbound traffic
- ‚úÖ **Full availability zone support**
- ‚úÖ **Available in all Azure regions**

#### **Cost Impact:**
- üí∞ **Additional cost**: ~$3.65/month per Standard public IP
- üìä **For typical deployment**: 1 head node = ~$3.65/month additional cost

#### **Security Note:**
Standard SKU public IPs are **secure by default**, meaning inbound traffic is denied unless explicitly allowed via Network Security Group (NSG) rules. This provides better security than Basic SKU which was open by default.

#### **Regional Deployment:**
With Standard SKU, you can now deploy successfully in **any Azure region** including East US, as Standard SKU has much higher quota limits everywhere, unlike Basic SKU which has been phased out in many primary regions.

## ü©∫ Diagnostics & Troubleshooting Tool (HPC-pack-Insight-v5.ps1)

Use the diagnostics script in `Scripts/HPC-pack-Insight-v5.ps1` to quickly inspect cluster health, services, ports, certificates, metrics, and history.

### Highlights
- Port reachability testing (single port or ranges)
- Certificate discovery and validation for HPC Pack communication
- Built-in DiagnosticTests (wraps HpcDiagnosticHost cert test)
- Cluster/job/node history helpers
- Metric value history export to CSV

### Prerequisites
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 (run console as Administrator)
- On the head node for best results; Microsoft.Hpc module enables richer outputs when available

### Quick start
```powershell
# Show help
.\Scripts\HPC-pack-Insight-v5.ps1 -h

# Test a single TCP port to a node
.\Scripts\HPC-pack-Insight-v5.ps1 PortTest -NodeName IaaSCN104 -Port 40002

# Test a range of ports
.\Scripts\HPC-pack-Insight-v5.ps1 PortTest -NodeName IaaSCN104 -Ports @(40000..40003)

# Run built-in diagnostic tests (includes certificate test)
.\Scripts\HPC-pack-Insight-v5.ps1 DiagnosticTests

# Export metric value history to CSV (date range optional)
.\Scripts\HPC-pack-Insight-v5.ps1 MetricValueHistory -MetricStartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-7) -MetricEndDate (Get-Date) -MetricOutputPath .\metrics.csv

# Show node state history (last 7 days by default)
.\Scripts\HPC-pack-Insight-v5.ps1 NodeHistory -NodeName IaaSCN104 -DaysBack 7

# Recent jobs and optional node history
.\Scripts\HPC-pack-Insight-v5.ps1 JobHistory -DaysBack 3
```

### Certificate details surfaced in DiagnosticTests
When the HPC communication certificate is located (thumbprint from `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\HPC` or `Get-HpcInstallCertificate`), the output includes:

- Thumbprint
- SerialNumber
- NotBefore
- NotAfter
- HasPrivateKey
- Days Until Expiry and overall status

If the certificate cannot be found locally, the tool reports the discovered thumbprint (if available) and a warning.

### Tips
- If WinRM TrustedHosts is empty and you‚Äôre troubleshooting node reachability, consider adding problematic node names on the head node:
   - Overwrite: `Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value "<NodeName>" -Force`
   - Append: `Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value "<NodeName>" -Concatenate -Force`
